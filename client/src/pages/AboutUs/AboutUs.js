            Given the burgeoning human population in India in particular and
            world in general, many decisions taken in the ‘interest of society’,
            invariably spell doom to the natural wealth of the land, with
            green-cover rapidly cleared to make room for an ever expanding human
            society. This is destined to backfire, for the very foundation of
            healthy life is based, among other things, on a clean environment,
            abundant rainfall, fertile of soil and pure water. It is therefore
            the need-of-the- hour, even in the interest of human society, to
            generate a greater respect for nature and to check over-exploitation
            of natural resources. More important, however, is for us to
            recognize the right for all life forms to exist independent of human
            whims and fancies, a right that is rarely ever acknowledged.
            Fruition of each of these goals is a long way off, but every step
            taken with this intention is a step taken in the right direction.

            DNA Life attempts, in its own modest way, to correct for this
            appalling imbalance and change the way we view nature. Conservation
            practices are adopted both actively and passively. Based primarily
            in Anuganalu, a village in Karnataka, India (at the foot of the
            verdant Western Ghats). Human activities were minimized around a
            barren stretch of rocky land, about 30 acres, which belongs to
            Anuganalu. The result was evident within three years when a slow
            regeneration of the forest that once, not so long ago, stretched up
            to the village was noticed. This area is now completely green thanks
            to additional efforts from DNA Life to afforest it.

            Being native to the region, local flora require little or no
            attention but benefit the farmer immensely by enriching soil
            fertility, recharging ground water and preventing soil erosion. DNA
            Life encourages farmers to grow these in addition to their own
            crops, and has already distributed hundreds of thousands of saplings
            to farmers. In parallel, DNA Life has convinced farmers to take up
            tree-based farming (forest farming or Kadu Krushi). Now most farmers
            have adopted forest farming methods in their own land, which is
            zero-investment and high-return to farmers. DNA Life is successful
            by transforming over 75% landscape into green space in villages
            around Anuganalu, which was less than 10% green in 2000.

            Deep ponds and lakes have silted over the years, are being de-silted
            for creating a lake that would not only enhance the local
            bio-diversity by supporting local flora and fauna, particularly as a
            bird- habitat, but would also benefit the denizens of the village by
            recharging ground water.

            Medicinal plants are grown here in order to preserve indigenous
            knowledge in medicine. DNA Life conducts workshops to sensitize
            villagers to the importance of natural wealth and the direct
            influence it has on the quality of their lives. Organic farming,
            soil and water conservation methods have been implemented in and
            around Anuganalu. DNA Life has worked with central and state
            government institutions like Karnataka Biodiversity Board, Forest
            Department, Watershed Department and Department of Agriculture. DNA
            Life is working to protect bio- diversity in a hill close to the
            village by establishing large watershed and rainforest area for
            hundred’s of villages.

            The ultimate objective of DNA Life, in addition to conservation and
            documentation, is to support and conduct research in rainforest
            biology particularly by involving farmers right from the beginning.
            This involvement of end-users (farmers) serves as a tool to preserve
            and protect the indigenous vegetation.

            The activities of DNA Life have proved to be nothing short of
            inspirational to the people whose lives it has touched. Several have
            returned with the intention of establishing a similar system in
            their own villages across India and abroad. The government and the
            forest department have always backed its activities as DNA Life
            looks forward to a steady growth in this goodwill and camaraderie.
